pso-description: "Platforma Opon is the biggest web page for bulk sale of tyres in Poland. Huge and maintained since 2012 project
 was a quite challenge for me when i began working on it in 2022. Many files and legacy code taught me how working on big projects looks like.
When i got to know the project better, I worked in small, 2 man team, so my responsibilities were everything between small visual fixes,
to integration with external services like allegro or przelewy24 and creating logic behind buying 'subscription'."
